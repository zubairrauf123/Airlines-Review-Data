0,58994af99bf56223b02ab85c,Canada,1,pia-pakistan-international-airlines,Economy,8.0,We have travelled to Pakistan many times on PIA from Toronto to Karachi and I have to say that the experience was great. Staff were friendly and courteous and the inflight entertainment was very good. The food was good except on the return. The bathrooms were very dirty but the overall experience was good.,,10,1,9
1,58994af99bf56223b02ab860,United States,0,lufthansa,Economy,3.0,"4/10/2015 FRA-LAX LH 456. Lufthansa from FRA to LAX on A380 economy class and won't repeat this mistake anytime in the future. Seat pitch is listed as 31"" but felt more like 28"". Width is listed as 17"" and that felt about right. Seat configuration is 3-4-3 which is pretty much standard. It was just too cramped again I believe the pitch that Lufthansa list is wrong as I've never felt so tight with a 31"" pitch and I've recently lost 25 pounds. All else was great. Food was above industry standard staff were polite and attentive after meal drinks were plentiful and included brandy wine and beer at no charge. Snacks were passed out during duration of flight. Flight entertainment was weak but having a place to charge my laptop was handy as well as WiFi although slow and charged at 17euro. Unfortunately I have a bad back and will have to take a different carrier next time out.",,12,7,5
2,58994af99bf56223b02ab864,United States,0,us-airways,Economy,1.0,On November 5 2014 I flew US Airways - what a mistake. I am disabled and my husband checked the night before to make sure a wheelchair would be ready at the airport. Seattle to Tucson via Phoenix. No wheelchair in Seattle finally after waiting at check-in for 45 minutes the desk clerk was worried I was going to miss the flight and grabbed a wheel chair and I was put on plane at the last minute. Arrived at Phoenix - no wheelchair - person working at desk ignored me. Another passenger interrupted her and told her I needed assistance and I finally got help. Arrived in Tucson - no wheelchair - had to walk from tarmac to baggage. Wheelchair available for another customer - asked the person if he could get one for me he shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Customer service a nightmare - do not want to talk to you in person. The prices are good but they do not care about there customers.,,5,7,-2

4,58994af99bf56223b02ab869,Canada,1,air-canada,Economy,8.0,AC Jazz and Express from YTZ-YQB via YUL was a breeze in spite of heavy fog and two cancellations the ground staff at Billy Bishop Airport was very helpful and respectful to passengers. AC Jazz from YQB to YYZ was smooth and the flight attendants were great. It was a smooth and pleasant flight back to Toronto.,,5,1,4
5,58994af99bf56223b02ab867,Finland,0,airbaltic,Economy,1.0,I chose this company as it had good fares for our trip however by the end of the trip if I sum up all the expenses it required along the way I could have bought tickets for a better airline that provides all the needed services. We had to pay 10 eur per person to do check-in at the counter. Who has heard of that? We received an email a few days before with the online check-in and it didn't state anywhere that if we don't do it online we would have to pay at the airport. Not surprisingly at the airport everyone who was on the same flight with us had the very same problem. The company is not transparent with its customers and it uses these hidden fees so they can cover up their margins. We had to pay extra for every 20 kg piece of luggage seats transaction fees and there were no meals during the flights. So adding up all these costs to the initial price of the ticket I could have easily flown with an all inclusive airline. Coming to customer service it seems that Air Baltic has no idea what that means. One crew member was extremely rude during the boarding process. She replied to my questions in a very rude way. It is sad to see that for some companies the idea of customer service is still a new concept.,,7,7,0
6,58994af99bf56223b02ab86a,Maldives,0,srilankan-airlines,Economy,1.0,BKK-CMB-MLE. Handling agents at BKK were very poorly informed on running the system numerous problems arose and it took over an hour to check in. During check-in they informed us that the CMB-MLE leg of our trip had been cancelled and that we that it was rescheduled for next morning. At CMB we asked the information counter about the transit hotel assigned to us at BKK. They claimed to have never heard of it and were no help at all whatsoever. All this happened in the middle of the night so we were really frustrated. The woman at the transit counter was exceptionally rude. We were then put on a bus with some other passengers and were brought to a small and very dirty little inn quite a long way from the airport. On the way to BKK the MLE handling agents refused to check us in saying that our ticket (issued by SriLankan) was for 15 days while our visa covered only 14. Right from the ticket agents to the transit hotels this was a ghastly experience.,,2,4,-2
7,58994af99bf56223b02ab86b,United Kingdom,0,british-airways,First Class,3.0,"LHR-NCL-LHR. I was rather disappointed to learn that my early morning Sunday flight was cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning I was to fly - the whole point of this trip was so I could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sisters wedding, saving time and also money due to the trains being so expensive. I managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed I had to now arrange last minute accommodation, I thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the BA app. What it didn't tell me was that the flight I re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as I received a a text/app notification telling me so - I think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and I spent a couple of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. The plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and I liked the simple but elegant cabin. BA staff also do let things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here. Cabin Crew were fine, but lack warmth of some other Airlines. Sadly there aren't any other options on this route, so will probably be switching back to rail, despite sometimes competitive fares.",LHR to NCL,16,13,3
8,58994af99bf56223b02ab86c,United Kingdom,1,emirates,Economy,9.0,NCL-DXB-DAC-DXB-NCL. Departed from NCL on newest 777-300ER with newest ICE system flight very full but experience was overall pleasant. Catering from NCL is generally always good there was nothing to complain about and staff were efficient and generally good if not over-friendly. Flight from DXB-DAC was on time and again very full on older 777-200 with older ICE system. Cabin Crew on this sector were excellent however and even checked in on my mother who had been upgraded to Business Class for us. Toilets in ridiculous state given 4 hour flight but again due to clientele rather than crews fault. Return was on Christmas Eve and surprisingly busy flight from DAC-DXB. Return flight is always over-timed by an hour - meant we didn't get on to the plane until an hour after arriving at the gate. Flight was on newer 777-200ER with newest ICE system. Cabin service was efficient and brusque if not necessarily very friendly and inflight catering was ok. Arrival into Dubai was early and the airport was very quiet - we had a wait of more than 4 hours for connection to NCL - so collected our complimentary food vouchers from transfer desk. DXB-NCL unusually on 3 class 777-300ER with newest ICE system. Cabin Crew were unusually mostly British due to a lot returning home for Christmas break. Catering was disappointing with choice particularly breakfast offering but otherwise pleasant. Arrival into NCL was late and held on tarmac for rather unusual amount of time before being parked at remote stand and bussed to terminal. Baggage out promptly. Would use again based on this experience - the sector DAC is never an easy one and on the whole Emirates made the experience rather more tolerable than it can be and the price was incredible value for money especially long-haul from a regional UK destination.,,18,11,7
9,58994af99bf56223b02ab86d,United Kingdom,0,flybe,Economy,4.0,"STN-NCL. The booking process is confusing and unclear there is a constant feeling you're trying to be tricked into paying for things you don't want. Online check in did not work and seems to be a common recurring problem going by other reviews here I fly with only hand baggage for these short hops so I can arrive later at the airport and walk through without having to queue at a desk - this defeats the point of this if I have to check-in the old-fashioned way. Of course I didn't get a window seat because they had been taken and I didn't want to pay the obscene charge to pre-select. They chose Stansted for this route - this airport is decrepit and dark security is overcrowded and a mess with poor management of queues. Moving on to boarding - the misinformation flyBe give which adds to passengers frustration - we were told we had to be at the gate 45 minutes before the flight this is excessive and pointless. Arriving at the gate the board said it was open - it wasn't with no one about. Then it said they were boarding again it wasn't. Then finally 15 minutes before the depart time said gate was closed - we haven't even boarded. We didn't board until the scheduled depart time. Boarding was on foot in the rain with no bus or sheltered path. Upon boarding it was clear the Dash 8 Q400 aircraft had seen better days cabin looked very tatty and tired and a lot of passengers didn't seem to be aware of the size limitations for cabin baggage boarding took significantly longer than it should have. The seat itself was thin hard and unsupportive and looked very tatty with scratches and frayed bits hanging off. Departed 15 minutes late with no explanation or reason given for the delay. Cabin Service Manager was friendly but her colleague was surly and stroppy. FlyBe like to pretend they are above the low-cost carriers such as easyJet but they are anything but and this is very poor replacement for the easyJet's flight from/to Gatwick that were ended at the end of March - not only with the odd flight times and use of Stansted but also because of the poor quality of their short-haul product. It's ironic with their current tag line of ""Faster than road or rail"" they are trying to compete with these forms of transport but with the delays it is anything but and the overall experience is so joyless - it is doing the opposite and I will probably save the hassle and get the train next time.",,19,27,-8
10,58994af99bf56223b02ab870,United Kingdom,1,pia-pakistan-international-airlines,Economy,9.0,I found my trip from LHR-ISB very easy going and comfortable the flight left on time crew and staff were very enthusiastic and willing to help the plane itself was clean and presentable with great legroom a good amount of movies to choose from. In flight meals and snacks were efficiently given out and had plenty in terms of choice same on the return journey! The airline operates a more than generous 40kg allowance per passenger which is another added bonus.,,13,1,12
11,58994af99bf56223b02ab871,United Kingdom,1,norwegian,Economy,9.0,EDI-ARN-EDI. They text you flight details on opening of check-in (2 hours before the flight) along with gate number which is useful information. Manual check-in only at Edinburgh as they do not offer online check-in however no queues. Older B737-300 and did not have wifi available. They did have the new slimline leather seats and seat pitch was more than adequate but for those taller than 5'6 it maybe more of an issue. Staff on board were friendly and onboard food available to buy was reasonably priced and looked of good quality. Landed in Stockholm early. Return flight similar to outgoing. Norwegian take part in Arlanda's common check-in kiosk system which allows you to check-in at Stockholm Central Railway Station before catching the Arlanda Express. Baggage allowance is generous and flexible. Landing at Arlanda is a big bonus as is allocation of seats before boarding and the overall service is worth the little bit extra over the competing service offered by Ryanair to Skavsta (which isn't even in Stockholm) - also without the general unpleasantness with that operator. Overall very satisfied with the service.,,16,6,10
12,58994af99bf56223b02ab873,Switzerland,0,turkish-airlines,Business Class,3.0,Flew GVA-IST-AUH. Seats were dirty and could hardly be reclined footrest is a joke. On both legs staff rushed through the meal to the point where my husband had to physically hold on to his tray (IST-AUH). Staff not very friendly no greeting during boarding and an unapproachable attitude during the flights seats in front of us were used by cabin crew to sleep during the flight between IST-AUH. Entertainment system was poor compared to what other airlines have to offer. On both flights the toilet was smelly and did not feel clean. Not looking forward to our return flights nor the changing of planes in Istanbul we will avoid them in the future.,,6,5,1
13,58994af99bf56223b02ab874,United Kingdom,1,kenya-airways,Economy,5.0,Just last week I was on another Kenya Airways flight but this time the experience far from what I'd expected. The aircraft itself had only just returned to Nairobi with a full load of passengers about an hour before we boarded it. Of course it had been prepared for our flight but not well enough - the toilet I used even before departure was grubby the carpeting on the floor of the passenger cabin still had tiny remnants of a food spill from the previous flight the inflight entertainment system worked only partly - the flight tracker did not work at all throughout the 8 hr flight to Amsterdam - the choice in movies and music was so limited and the sound quality so inadequate. A far cry from the very enjoyable flight on the KLM B747-400 that had flown me on the outward leg. But the food was fairly good and there was one or two particularly attractive flight attendants.,,10,5,5
14,58994af99bf56223b02ab875,Finland,1,turkish-airlines,Economy,7.0,"This was my first time on Turkish Airlines (Helsinki-Istanbul-Helsinki). The plane was ok I liked the leather seats and there was enough space for me. The seats seemed a bit ""worn out "" to me though. The plane could have been tidier I guess it had just brought passengers to Helsinki and there was only a little time to clean it. The toilets were much cleaner than on other airliners' planes which was nice. Food was really good and it felt luxurious to be able choose from two menus! They showed quite new movies during the flight but when we flew back to Helsinki there was no sound coming from the audio system. This problem affected all the passengers not just me. The flight attendant couldn't do anything about this problem. What really upset me was the cabin crew's attitude on safety matters. Flight attendants didn't care at all about the position of passengers' seats tray tables or hand luggage during take off and landing. It definitely didn't give a good impression of safety issues. I have also got used to cabin crew paying attention to seat belt sign during turbulent weather but they just let people move around and use toilets normally.",,16,9,7
15,58994af99bf56223b02ab876,Austria,0,turkish-airlines,Business Class,4.0,Although seats are very good there are severe limitations: Istanbul Airport offers no extra tracks for Business class passengers which means that you have to line up with all the others in the middle of the night/early in the morning (usually) to pass the overcrowded security checks. There is a fast track lane but it was always closed when I needed to pass it (4 times in the past 2 months). Istanbul airport is deplorable not coping with the rapid expansion of TK. This means that your expensive Business class experiences finds a rather unpleasant middle piece. Even more disturbing is the very wrong catering service concept and staff quality. Usually one pays for an expensive business class seat to find rest and piece and some sleep. TK assumes that you are in it for the culinary experience and serve food regardless of the flying time thus limiting the rest time severely. For instance while flying from Istanbul to Cape Town TK started serving dinner at midnight for over 3 hours. Then they wake you up 2 hours before landing to serve breakfast. Even worse is that the crew is serving and removing the food very noisily moving plates glasses etc for hours. The 11 hours flight to Cape Town thus had only 3 hours of quite sleeping time. Worst affected are the first and last rows of the business class being close to the pantry. Another bad example was the flight from Istanbul to Doha: here same procedure: although guests wanted to sleep right after the take-off (midnight again). Food was served almost the entire flight (4 hours). Noise was unbearable as the pantry did not even had a shielding curtain. Besides the fact that the food is nothing special the quality of the crews is very heterogeneous. During the flight to Doha the chief cabin attendant was reading the newspaper drank tea in front of the business class passengers (no curtain) and was observing leisurely the work of his subordinates. The staff chats constantly with each other and although there are more than enough attendants on board it is not possible to place a successful request as the chain of command is long and unclear responsibilities seem to exist.,,12,22,-10
16,58994af99bf56223b02ab878,United Kingdom,1,etihad-airways,Business Class,8.0,I booked to travel from MAN to AUH on EY22 on 20th Dec. I called EY's call centre to upgrade using miles/cash to business where I was assured that there are plenty of seats available and should head to the airport 3 hrs before departure to process this. The information given was completely incorrect as the desks opened 4 hrs before departure and all seats were taken by then which was very frustrating and disappointing. EY ground staff and EY's Business class lounge staff at MAN acknowledged the mishap and were very courteous and attentive and attempted to solve this problem. Return flight on EY21 on the 29th of December light load in J class we were well looked after by the excellent crew in J. as usual EY's catering is excellent cabin crew attentive and good hard product. I just wish they sort out the unhelpful call centre and bring back the old amenity kits in J class with Aigner products that were infinitely better than the current cheap substitutes.,,17,7,10
17,58994af99bf56223b02ab879,Canada,0,pia-pakistan-international-airlines,Economy,,I traveled from YYZ-KHI with PIA last year. My first and last time with PIA. I would rather pay a few extra bucks and fly Emirates or Turkish Airlines. During my flight my seat was broken and I asked the male flight attendant to change my seat. He just gave me a dry response by saying that the flight was full. I was shocked to hear this type of customer service. The least he could have done was to offer to fix the seat. I was sitting on the broken seat for 14 hours. I didn't go to the washroom because 2 of them were leaking and the other was out of order. The IFE system did not work at all and when I asked the flight attendant to fix it he said ok and just disappeared. Overall a very bad experience with PIA and there are a lot more options.,,6,5,1

The seats were more comfortable than economy and service was excellent. Hot food friendly stewards and great IFE. Cabin crew were attentive catering for the needs of my 2 year old daughter. Lahore to Bahawalpur was better experience as the plane was half empty. Return journey the same. But the accommodation for the transit passengers was not good.,,9,2,7

Reserved seats for all four flights for me my wife and 8 year old daughter. Not one of the flights had us seated together. Had to request other kind passengers to move. Food is fish meat or veg with same sauce. Seats were average with leg room better on the short haul flights than the long haul which was irritating. A lot of the passengers were unhappy with the allocation of seats. Looks like RJ cant deal with full capacity.,,5,3,2
21,58994af99bf56223b02ab87d,Australia,0,etihad-airways,Business Class,1.0,"Terrible experience with Etihad. Booked 5 business class seats Sydney-Abu Dhabi-Cairo return for family with 3 children. Thought it would make the trip easier as younger 2 kids only 5 and 2. Also Business promised overnight hotel accommodation in Abu Dhabi so we justified the huge expense and thought we'd travel in style! Every leg we were seated separately including putting the 2 year old next to strangers. Just assumed I guess we would have seating together. After first leg refused to change seating for other legs. Refused - told we had to wait until on the aircraft and for attendants to approach other passengers to change. Watched anxiously on every leg as they seated and settled every other passenger before they would try to get my kids near us. Arrived late at night after long flight into Abu Dhabi from Sydney expecting hotel room. Airport almost deserted eventually found long line of weary travellers waiting for single attendant. Waited in line for 2 hours with children and adults close to hysterical by then. Eventually reach end of line and are told no booking made for room for us - then later found. Kids in separate hotel room on another floor! Unable even to have adjacent rooms. Service in plane polite but hardly existent. Bell would expire before attended. Twice sent feedback to Etihad. First not even answered second approach through social media got quick request for details which I provided. Response then was not an apology but ""disappointment' at my negative 'impression' of their superior service and well trained staff. They assured me that just because I didn't get my 'preferred seating' (as if I'd just wanted a window seat rather than to be near my children) they win awards for their 'inspired' experience. Would never fly Etihad again!",,15,14,1

The first was to South Africa on Etihad and South African the latest was on Etihad and Alitalia - both disastrous. We travelled from Doha through Abu Dhabi to Rome and onto Venice waiting for our Cruise in the Mediterranean now Alitalia ground staff have been on strike. Etihad knew of this strike but still checked my bags through to Venice knowing my bags could have not made it through. It has been three days without our bags and they can't even locate them and I will have to go on a 12 day cruise without luggage other than that I will have to fly with them to go back home.,,4,4,0

The portion from Frankfurt to Doha was on an Airbus A330 with the new business class which was very nice and excellent service with wonderful meal selection I really liked the Bavarian Goose.

The foot rest was very narrow the IFE screen was big but the movie and TV selection was not too big. Food was good and the portions where generous I enjoyed the crepe for breakfast no amenity kit was offered. Flight attendants were professional when needed they were present but otherwise they did not bother you when watching a TV program or a movie as does happen on other airlines.
